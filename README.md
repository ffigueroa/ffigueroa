## üöÄ About Me

As a passionate software engineer with over a decade of experience, I've honed my skills from early days with PHP to specializing in Javascript, Python, and Go. Throughout my journey as a Full Stack Developer, I've crafted and integrated robust hosting services, leveraging cutting-edge tools such as NextJs, Express, and Docker for web and mobile app development. My expertise extends to cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, and I've adeptly utilized Kubernetes and Terraform to optimize infrastructure and ensure scalability.

Beyond technical development, I've gained substantial experience in diverse backend and frontend integrations, ranging from access control systems utilizing various languages and serving through RESTful APIs and WebSockets to eCommerce integrations with platforms like Shopify. I've also crafted tools for web scraping, enabling benchmarking based on data insights.

I thrive in team-oriented environments and possess exemplary interpersonal skills, ensuring seamless adaptation to new projects and collaborations. With a genuine love for technology and an insatiable drive for continuous learning, I eagerly embrace the challenges and opportunities of the ever-evolving software engineering landscape.

Outside of work, I cherish moments with my family and indulge in activities like mountain biking and karting.
